# DeLorean-Mail Datechanger  

Hello everyone! This is the magic email filter, that you need to use with postfix to change most of the dates in incoming and outgoing email.

It communicates with the dmail-connect client via localhost UDP on port 1337.  
You need to be running dmail-connect at all times to make this filter program work properly. It uses the time offset provided by dmail-connect to change the timestamps (by subtracting the amount of hours given)  
It communicates using the Future Gadget Protocol messages.  

Configure your postfix server like outlined on http://www.postfix.org/FILTER_README.html#simple_filter using the emailfilter.sh script provided here. Turn on the filter for emails arriving via smtp, smtps and submission.
